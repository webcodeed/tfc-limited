      <p class="text-lg font-semibold text-ink-800 mb-6">In today's evolving security landscape, protecting physical assets and people requires more than standalone cameras or alarms. It demands integrated systems that provide real-time visibility and immediate actionable alerts. For senior decision-makers managing facilities, industrial sites, or government projects across Nigeria, leveraging combined CCTV and alarm solutions is a critical strategy to strengthen security posture and operational efficiency.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-ink-900 mt-8 mb-4">The Urgency of Integrated Security Systems</h2>
      
      <p>Fragmented security setups - where cameras, alarms, and access controls operate independently can leave gaps in incident detection and response. Alarm triggers with no accompanying video context, or surveillance footage with no automated alerts, lead to slow reactions and missed threats. Integration offers a unified platform delivering synchronized data flow, rapid incident verification, and coordinated responses.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-ink-900 mt-8 mb-4">Key Benefits of CCTV & Alarm Integration</h2>
      
      <ul class="space-y-3 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Enhanced Situational Awareness:</strong> Operators gain instant visual confirmation alongside alarm events, speeding decision-making.</li>
        <li><strong>Automated Controls:</strong> Systems trigger locking mechanisms, intercom announcements, or emergency calls without delay.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced False Alarms:</strong> Video verification helps distinguish non-threats from actual incidents, reducing unnecessary disruptions.</li>
        <li><strong>Centralized Monitoring:</strong> Manage multiple sites through a single interface, ideal for dispersed Nigerian enterprises and government facilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Detailed logs and automated reporting aid adherence to industry and legal standards.</li>
      </ul>
